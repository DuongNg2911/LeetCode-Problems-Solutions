# Solution Explained

## Approach
- Used Bottom-up approach
- Started from the second row of the matrix, for each element [r, c], modified it with the minimum number between ([r,c] + [r-1, c], [r,c] +
[r, c], [r, c] + [r-1, c+1]) 

## Complexity
- Time Complexity: O(n^2)
- Space Complexity: O(1)

## Result
